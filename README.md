# Hailo Applications Infrastructure

This repository provides the core infrastructure and pipelines required to run Hailo applications. It includes three key application pipelines:
- **Object Detection**
- **Pose Estimation**
- **Instance Segmentation**

Requirements
------------

- hailo_platform==4.19.0
- Pyhailort

## Using the Repository as a Pip Package
-----------------------------
To install the package, ensure you are inside a virtual environment with Pyhailort installed. Then, run the following command:
```shell script
pip install git+https://github.com/ronithailo/hailo-apps-infra.git
```
This will install the Hailo Applications Infrastructure package directly from the repository.


## Running the Pipelines
--------------------

1. Clone the repository:
    ```shell script
    git clone https://github.com/ronithailo/hailo-apps-infra.git
            
    cd hailo-apps-infra
    ```

2. Install the Python Package

    We recommend running it within a virtual environment.
    ```shell script
    pip install -v -e .
    ```
    This will install the package in editable mode, allowing you to make changes to the codebase and use them immediately without reinstalling.

3. Running Detection Pipeline:
    ```shell script
    python hailo_apps_infra/detection_pipeline.py 
    ```
    ![Example](./resources/detection.gif)
4. Running Pose Estimation Pipeline:
    ```shell script
    python hailo_apps_infra/pose_estimation_pipeline.py
    ```
    ![Example](./resources/pose_estimation.gif)
5. Running Instance Segmentation Pipeline:
    ```shell script
    python hailo_apps_infra/instance_segmentation_pipeline.py
    ```
    ![Example](./resources/instance_segmentation.gif)
## Pipeline Options
For more information about the available options, run any of the pipeline scripts with the -h flag:
    ```shell script
    python hailo_apps_infra/detection_pipeline.py -h
    ```
```shell script
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --input INPUT, -i INPUT
                        Input source. Can be a file, USB or RPi camera (CSI camera module). For RPi camera use '-i rpi' (Still in Beta). Defaults to example video resources/detection0.mp4
  --use-frame, -u       Use frame from the callback function
  --show-fps, -f        Print FPS on sink
  --arch {hailo8,hailo8l}
                        Specify the Hailo architecture (hailo8 or hailo8l). Default is None , app will run check.
  --hef-path HEF_PATH   Path to HEF file
  --disable-sync        Disables display sink sync, will run as fast as possible. Relevant when using file source.
  --dump-dot            Dump the pipeline graph to a dot file pipeline.dot
```
